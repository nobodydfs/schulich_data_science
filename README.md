# 📊 Data Analytics Portfolio – Yunan (Carrie) Zhang

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio!  
This repository highlights three end-to-end analytics projects that combine **data science**, **machine learning**, and **business strategy**.  
Each project demonstrates how I use Python and data visualization to translate data into actionable business insights.

## 💳 1. Credit Card Customer Segmentation (Clustering Analysis)

### 🎯 Objective  
Segment credit card users based on their transaction and repayment behavior to identify **low-, medium-, and high-value customers**.  
The goal is to support banks in **targeted marketing**, **credit management**, and **customer retention**.

### ⚙️ Approach & Models  
- **Data Preprocessing:** handled missing values, outliers, standardization, and correlation reduction.  
- **EDA:** examined distributions, tenure, and frequency patterns to understand spending habits.  
- **Models Tested:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Model.  
- **Best Model:** **K-Means (K=3)** with Silhouette Score **0.3902** — clear, compact clusters.

### 🧩 Insights & Actions  
| Cluster | Customer Type | Strategy |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Cluster 0 | Low spenders, low credit limit | Educate customers, offer low-interest promotions. |
| Cluster 1 | Moderate users | Provide personalized rewards and cross-sell banking products. |
| Cluster 2 | High-value customers | Offer premium rewards, higher limits, and VIP experiences. |

### 💼 Business Impact  
Helped define 3 clear customer segments, enabling data-driven decisions for customer engagement, risk control, and loyalty marketing.

## 🛍️ 2. EcomX Retailers – Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Segmentation

### 🎯 Objective  
Predict and classify **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** for an e-commerce company to identify **high-value** and **low-value** customers.  
Support resource allocation and personalized marketing strategies.

### ⚙️ Approach & Tools  
- **Feature Engineering:** built RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), tenure, and lifespan.  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, KNN.  
  → **Best model:** **Logistic Regression** for highest precision and recall.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.

### 💬 Key Insights  
- High-value customers: generate most revenue through frequent, high-value purchases.  
- Low-value customers: low engagement and limited purchasing activity.  

### 💰 Business Outcome  
- **High-value segment:** +\$25,000 potential revenue through personalized campaigns.  
- **Low-value segment:** \$30,000 marketing budget saved by reducing low-return efforts.  
➡️ **Total impact: \$55,000 revenue improvement.**

## 🎬 3. StreamFlow – Churn Analysis and Retention Insights

### 🎯 Objective  
Analyze churn for **StreamFlow**, a subscription-based streaming platform, to uncover churn drivers and suggest retention strategies.

### ⚙️ Approach  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas for cleaning and transformation; Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization.  
- **Metrics Computed:**  
  - Churn Rate – **24.6%**  
  - MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue) – **\$11,012.46**  
  - ARPU (Average Revenue per User) – **\$14.61**  
  - CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) – **\$95.11**  

### 🔍 Key Findings  
- Main churn reason: **price sensitivity** — customers feel services don’t match price.  
- Highest churn in **Standard tier** users.  
- **Younger users** churn more often; **higher-rating** users are more loyal.

### 💡 Recommendations  
- Introduce **flexible pricing** and bundled packages.  
- Improve **content quality and personalization**.  
- Launch **youth-focused engagement campaigns**.

### 📈 Estimated Impact  
Reducing churn by just **5%** could retain **123 additional users/month**, adding **\$1,796** in monthly revenue.
